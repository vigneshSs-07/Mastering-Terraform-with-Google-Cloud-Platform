Workflows
Terraform CLI includes several commands to make Terraform code more convenient to work with. Integrating these commands into your editing workflow can potentially save you time and effort.

The **terraform console command** starts an interactive shell for evaluating Terraform expressions, which can be a faster way to verify that a particular resource argument results in the value you expect.

The **terraform fmt command** rewrites Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style, so you don't have to waste time making minor adjustments for readability and consistency. It works well as a pre-commit hook in your version control system.

The **terraform validate command validates** the syntax and arguments of the Terraform configuration files in a directory, including argument and attribute names and types for resources and modules. The plan and apply commands automatically validate a configuration before performing any other work, so validate isn't a crucial part of the core workflow, but it can be very useful as a pre-commit hook or as part of a continuous integration pipeline.
