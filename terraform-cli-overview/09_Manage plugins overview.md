## Manage plugins overview
This topic provides an overview of the how to manage plugins that Terraform relies on to manage various types of resources. Providers are the only plugin type Terraform users interact with. Refer to Providers in the Terraform language docs for additional information about providers.

### Plugin signatures
This topic provides information about the types of signatures that can be built into plugins you install. Terraform only authenticates provider plugins fetched from a registry.

Types of plugin signatures
Terraform providers installed from the registry are cryptographically signed. Terraform verifies the signature during installation. There are three types of signatures:

Providers signed by HashiCorp: HashiCorp builds, signs, and supports these providers.
Providers signed by trusted partners: A third party builds, signs, and supports these providers. HashiCorp verifies the ownership of the private key and provides a chain of trust to the CLI to verify ownership programatically.
Self-signed providers: A third party builds, signs, and supports these providers. HashiCorp does not provide a verification or chain of trust for the signature. You may obtain and validate fingerprints manually if you want to ensure you are using a binary you can trust.


### Command: providers
The terraform providers command shows information about the provider requirements of the configuration in the current working directory, as an aid to understanding where each requirement was detected from.


### terraform version command
The terraform version command prints the current version of the Terraform binary and all installed plugins.


### terraform providers lock command
The terraform providers lock adds new provider selection information to the dependency lock file without initializing the referenced providers.

### terraform providers mirror command
The terraform providers mirror command downloads the providers required for the current configuration and copies them into a directory in the local filesystem.

### terraform providers schema command
The terraform providers schema command print detailed schemas for the providers used in the current configuration.
